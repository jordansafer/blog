## What is a computer?

A computer is a device that remembers things, and updates based on inputs, and gives outputs. Like my laptop. It remembers things, I hit buttons on my keyboard (updates), and it shows stuff on the monitor (outputs).

1. First, electricity runs through the wires bringing power. Like a river:

1. Electricity powers the "clock". This is a circuit that is constantly turning on and off. And in my laptop, it flips more than 1 billion times a second. Think of it like a really fast windmill. (Or watermill if you like streams)

1. The clock makes the computer run through a set of instructions stored in its memory.
